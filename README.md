#our imaginary scenario for this project

Lezzet Kebap-Restaurant's menu was a culinary masterpiece, showcasing a variety of kebabs, each carefully crafted to perfection.
The name "Lezzet" meaning "delicious" in Turkish perfectly captured the essence of this culinary haven.
Our aim as Lezzet Kebap - Restaurant; It is to share the local kebab delicacies that have been coming since 1996 with our customers. Our establishment, which was established for the first time in Adana in 1996, has quickly gained a reputation and has been highly preferred by our customers. It was observed that it was found to be insufficient in other kebabs, especially in the other kebabs. For this reason, we have opened a branch in Istanbul and Izmir in order to spread our kebab culture in Istanbul and Izmir and to serve the flavors of these regions in a better way. As a result of the research, it has been seen that unlike the Adana culture of the people of Istanbul, Borulce appetizers and lighter desserts are preferred as dessert. In the studies we have carried out for Izmir, there are changes in our menus according to the preferences they have made in the Adana culture, as well as the kebab culture, dessert culture and appetizer culture. Our main goal in this regard, apart from the promotion of Adana kebab culture, is to offer the best service by considering the preferences of our customers according to our branches.

In this project; KEREM KESKIN designed and created our website for Adana. The web page view of Istanbul was designed and created by ECE NUR BALKAN. The content and design view of the province of Izmir was created by ZULEYHA IRMAK. Also, the HOME PAGE in our project was designed by all teammates.
All of our teammates used the SEA MONKEY editor in our project.
